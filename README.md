#TODO:
Replace 'https://example.com/updates' and 'https://example.com/update_file.zip' with the actual URLs where you host the version information and the update file, respectively. Additionally, update the current_version variable with the version number of your current client.

## TLDR;
When you run this script, it will check for updates, download and install them if available, and provide appropriate messages indicating whether updates were found and if the update process was successful.


## EDUCATIONAL USES ONLY
Please use this script responsibly and ensure you have the necessary permissions and consent to update the client application. Additionally, take care to implement error handling and proper backup mechanisms during the update process to avoid any issues.
